# Examples

This directory contains several example questions you can do to get yourself either familiar with Kubernetes and/or maybe even help you prepare for the CKA(D) Exams. And these examples are by no means enough for successfully completing CKA(D) examns, just to get you started. You still need to work (almost) daily with Kubernetes and dreaming about everthing K8s related. :).
